# DSE 511 Final Project

Welcome to the repository for the DSE 511 final project.

## Problem Description
This project involves data analysis and visualization of a Depression Dataset(DSS.csv) implemented in Python, R, SQl, and Matlab. 

## Data
The dataset used in this project has the following features:
The dataset contains 502 entries and 11 columns. 
Here's a summary of the columns:

* Gender: Categorical, with entries such as "Male" and "Female".
* Age: Numeric, representing the age of respondents.
* Academic Pressure: Numeric (float), likely a scale measuring pressure (e.g., 1–5).
* Study Satisfaction: Numeric (float), likely a scale measuring satisfaction (e.g., 1–5).
* Sleep Duration: Categorical, with values such as "7-8 hours", "5-6 hours", etc.
* Dietary Habits: Categorical, e.g., "Moderate", "Healthy", "Unhealthy".
* Have you ever had suicidal thoughts?: Categorical, with values "Yes" and "No".
* Study Hours: Numeric, representing daily study hours.
* Financial Stress: Numeric, representing stress levels (scale not specified).
* Family History of Mental Illness: Categorical, with values "Yes" and "No".
* Depression: Categorical, with values "Yes" and "No".

## Implementation Steps
1. Check for missing values and anomalies.
2. Performing descriptive analysis (e.g., mean, median) for numeric columns.
3. Analyzing categorical variables to identify patterns.
4. Generate visualizations for clearer insights. 
5. Explore correlations between variables (e.g., academic pressure and depression).
