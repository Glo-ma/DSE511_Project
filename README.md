# DSE 511 Final Project

Welcome to the repository for the DSE 511 final project.

## Problem Description
This project involves data analysis and visualization of a Depression Dataset(DSS.csv) implemented in Python, R, SQl, and Matlab. 

## Data
The dataset used in this project has the following features:
The dataset contains 502 entries and 11 columns. 
Here's a summary of the columns:

#Gender: Categorical, with entries such as "Male" and "Female".

#Age: Numeric, representing the age of respondents.

#Academic Pressure: Numeric (float), likely a scale measuring pressure (e.g., 1–5).

#Study Satisfaction: Numeric (float), likely a scale measuring satisfaction (e.g., 1–5).

#Sleep Duration: Categorical, with values such as "7-8 hours", "5-6 hours", etc.

#Dietary Habits: Categorical, e.g., "Moderate", "Healthy", "Unhealthy".

#Have you ever had suicidal thoughts?: Categorical, with values "Yes" and "No".

#Study Hours: Numeric, representing daily study hours.

#Financial Stress: Numeric, representing stress levels (scale not specified).

#Family History of Mental Illness: Categorical, with values "Yes" and "No".

#Depression: Categorical, with values "Yes" and "No".

## Approach
#Check for missing values and anomalies.
#Perform descriptive analysis (e.g., mean, median) for numeric columns.
#Analyze categorical variables to identify patterns.
#Explore correlations between variables (e.g., academic pressure and depression).
#Generate visualizations for clearer insights.
